                                Most of the time, if there’s an idea floating around, it gets tossed to me to shape into something real. And if you’re ever wondering, ‘Who played that guitar part?’ That’s me.
                                People see Semmy and think, ‘Oh he must’ve done it all, he’s the good looking one!’ but nah, I promise I’m doing more than just standing in the back 😄
                                At the end of the day, I just love making music that feels good. And if it looks good too? That’s a bonus. :3 ”

                                But behind the scenes, I’m also the one writing lyrics, leading vocals, and shaping the heart of our songs. A lot of times, Uki will tell me a story or a feeling he has, and I’ll turn that into something people can sing along to. That’s the magic I live for.
                                I also help with melody and chord choices, and I handle most of the visual stuff the social media designs, the aesthetic ideas just trying to make sure <a href="" class=" text-amber-400 font-semibold">ToYouth</a> not only sounds good, but feels good, too.
                                I guess I’m here to turn feelings into music, and make it all look pretty while I’m at it. ”

                            <a href="" class="text-amber-400 text-2xl font-bold" >ToYouth</a> is an Indonesian music duo made up of <a href="" class="font-bold">Semmy and Uki</a> — two artists who met by chance during a <a href="" class="font-bold">collaboration</a> and quickly found a spark worth holding on to. What started as a <a href="" class="font-bold">one-time project turned into something much more personal</a>, driven by a shared love for sound, storytelling, and constant exploration.
                            <a href="" class="font-bold">Semmy</a> lives in Bali. <a href="" class="font-bold">Uki</a> lives in Bekasi. <a href="" class="font-bold">Two different cities</a>, different scenes, different lives — but a single, shared vision. <a href="" class="font-bold">Despite the distance</a>, they’ve kept creating from their bedrooms, <a href="" class="font-bold">building songs out of voice notes</a>, late-night video calls, and long back-and-forths that often start as loose ideas and grow into full tracks with feeling.
                            Semmy is the band’s lead singer and primary lyricist. He’s got an instinct for melody and emotion — always listening, always thinking, always shaping raw thoughts into words people can sing along to. Uki is the guitarist, producer, and co-lead vocalist. His production style is warm and layered, giving every track a distinct color, often led by his guitar work and sharp ear for detail.
                            Together, they bring out the best in each other. Whether they’re exploring pop, indie, or progressive sounds, <a href="" class="font-bold">they’re always pushing themselves creatively</a> — experimenting with structure, learning new tools, and challenging each other to keep growing.
                            For <a href="" class="font-bold text-amber-400">ToYouth</a>, music isn’t just a craft. It’s how they talk, how they think, how they process the world. It’s the one constant that keeps them connected — not just to each other, but to anyone listening.
                            This is <a href="" class="font-bold text-amber-400">ToYouth</a>. Two cities, one sound. Built on distance. Bonded by music. <br/>
